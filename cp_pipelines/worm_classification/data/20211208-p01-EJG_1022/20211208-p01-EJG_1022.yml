  #### Conversion ####
  # For converting the TimePoint directory structure used for timelapse/video
  # experiments to a directory that can be loaded as a stack in Fiji. Will
  # automatically be set to run = True if flow[run] = True. If the converted
  # video should be saved in directories[output], set save_video to True and
  # add a rescale_multiplier (can be any float value). Flow will be run with the
  # unscaled video, but the saved video can still be scaled.
  convert:
    run: False
    save_video: True
    rescale_multiplier: 1

  #### Segmentation ####
  # If there is only one wavelength, keep the value blank. If there are multiple,
  # uncomment the wavelength you want segmented.
  segment:
    run: False
    wavelength:
      # - w1
      # - w2
      # - w3

  #### CellProfiler ####
  # Change run to True and uncomment a pipeline.
  cellprofiler:
    run: True
    pipeline:
      # - mf_celltox
      # - feeding
      - wormsize
      # - wormsize_trans

  #### Diagnostics ####
  # Usually set to true.
